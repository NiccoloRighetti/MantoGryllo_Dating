# MantoGryllo_Dating
Dated Phylogeny of Mantophasmatodea and Grylloblattodea
## Workflow
1) Dating through 5 runs of MCMCtree.
2) 5 runs with Embioptera and Zoraptera, 5 runs without them. List of species to be removed:
  - Aposthonia borneensis
  - Aposthonia japonica
  - Eosembia sp.
  - Zorotypus medoensis
3) Jacknife of fossils, they are 5. Every time I remove one of them, 5 runs each. I do this with the three clock models implemented in MCMCtree.
4) Total number of MCMCtree runs is 6x5x3 with Embioptera and Zoraptera and 6x5x3 without them.
